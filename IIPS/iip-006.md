## Simple Summary

Parameterize the DeFi Pulse Manager Contract with the target exchange, maximum trade size, and trade cool-down period for each asset in the DeFi Pulse Index to facilitate rebalances.

## Abstract

This IIP seeks to set the parameters for the initial trustless rebalance of the DPI. The three parameters to be set on a “per asset” basis are: 1) exchange, 2) maximum trade size, and 3) time between trades. Additionally, the community will agree on a set of addresses that can execute this rebalance (with the goal to open it up to anyone in the near future).

In order to determine the best exchange to use for each asset, the amount of each asset required to move the price 50 bps and 100 bps was sampled. The exchange with the best rates was selected-- in most cases there was an exchange with a clear market depth superiority. In order to determine the maximum trade size, the quantity that aligned with 50 bps of price impact on the best exchange was selected. The time between each trade was selected based on how much on-chain liquidity existed on other DEXes, assets were bucketed into 5, 10, and 15 minute cool off-periods.

Once these parameters are agreed upon they will be submitted to the ICManager contract, as outlined in IIP-005, by the IndexCoop Multi-Sig wallet.

## Specification

### Overview

The proposed parameters for the November rebalance are as follows:

| Component | Address                                    | Expected Trade Count (November Rebalance) | Exchange | Maximum Trade Size | Cool-Off Period (seconds) |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------ | ------------------------- |

Included in the table are the approximate amount of trades needed to trade the component to it’s target. These are subject to change based on changes in price between now and the rebalance on November 2nd, however the parameters as selected here will not change.

Additionally the following addresses will be allowed to execute rebalance trades. These addresses will only be able to specify the asset to trade, they cannot select any other parameters.

### Rationale

Some rationale for the parameters has already been provided in the abstract section. Below is the raw data justifying the choices based on the given rationale:

| Asset | Balancer @ 50 bps | Balancer @ 100 bps | Uniswap @ 50 bps | Uniswap @ 100 bps | Sushiswap @ 50 bps | Sushiswap @ 100 bps |
| ----- | ----------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| MKR   | **100 ETH**       | **350 ETH**        | 40 ETH           | 80 ETH            | Non-competitive    | Non-competitive     |
| AAVE  | 20.5 ETH          | 41 ETH             | **42 ETH**       | **83 ETH**        | 32 ETH             | 63 ETH              |
| SNX   | 11 ETH            | 25 ETH             | 21 ETH           | 41 ETH            | **67 ETH**         | **133 ETH**         |
| YFI   | Non-competitive   | Non-competitive    | 55 ETH           | 108 ETH           | **150 ETH**        | **300 ETH**         |
| UNI   | Non-competitive   | Non-competitive    | **295 ETH**      | **590 ETH**       | Non-competitive    | Non-competitive     |
| COMP  | 2 ETH             | 10 ETH             | 11 ETH           | 21.5 ETH          | **61 ETH**         | **123 ETH**         |
| REN   | Non-competitive   | Non-competitive    | **22 ETH**       | **43 ETH**        | 16 ETH             | 33 ETH              |
| LRC   | Non-competitive   | Non-competitive    | **30 ETH**       | **59 ETH**        | Non-competitive    | Non-competitive     |
| KNC   | Non-competitive   | Non-competitive    | **9.5 ETH**      | **19 ETH**        | Non-competitive    | Non-competitive     |
| BAL   | **250 ETH**       | **525 ETH**        | Non-competitive  | Non-competitive   | Non-competitive    | Non-competitive     |
| REP   | **20 ETH**        | **41 ETH**         | Non-competitive  | Non-competitive   | Non-competitive    | Non-competitive     |

As a brief reminder, the exchange with the best liquidity was chosen, on that exchange the amount of the component that causes a 50 bps price impact was selected as the maximum trade size. Cool off periods were bucketed into 5,10, and 15 minutes based on the liquidity found on other exchanges, the theory being the price impacts of trades will be arbed away quicker if liquidity exists elsewhere.
