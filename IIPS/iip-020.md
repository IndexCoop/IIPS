# Simple Summary

Raise the supply cap of the ETH2x-FLI from 50,000 units to 100,000 units and switch the DEX that the ETH2x-FLI uses to rebalance collateral from Uniswap to Sushiswap.

# Abstract

Adjust the following parameters on the ETH2x-FLI:

1. Raise the supply cap to 100,000 units.
2. Switch source for rebalancing liquidity from ETH:USDC pool on Uniswap to the ETH:USDC pool on Sushiswap.

# Motivation

For the initial launch, the ETH2x-FLI has a guarded roll-out to ensure stability with a more risky leverage type product. The initial supply cap was at 50,000 units. Weâ€™ve hit that supply cap and found the system to be behaving as expected and are ready to increase it to 100,000.

Initially, Uniswap was chosen as the pool from which the ETH2x-FLI would rebalance from because of its high ETH:USDC liquidity. Liquidity conditions have changed and Sushiswap has better liquidity for an ETH:USDC pool. Given the new conditions, we should leverage the pools on top of SushiSwap instead.

**FOR**

- Increase the ETH2x-FLI supply cap to 100k and change the DEX used for collateral rebalancing to Sushiswap.

**AGAINST**

- Do not increase the supply cap to 100k and do not change the DEX used for collateral rebalancing to Sushiswap.
