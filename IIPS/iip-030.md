# Simple Summary

Raise the supply cap of the ETH2x-FLI from 200,000 units to 400,000 units.

# Abstract

Adjust the following parameters on the ETH2x-FLI:

1. Raise the supply cap to 400,000 units.

# Motivation

For the initial launch, the ETH2x-FLI has a guarded roll-out to ensure stability with a more risky leverage type product. The initial supply cap was at 50,000 units, then raised to 100,000, and most recently raised to 200,000. Weâ€™re coming close to hitting that supply cap, have found the system to be behaving as expected and are ready to double it again to 400,000.
