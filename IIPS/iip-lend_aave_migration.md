## Simple Summary
Migrate LEND to AAVE tokens in the DeFi Pulse Index Set.

## Abstract
Aave is conducting a protocol upgrade to convert LEND governance tokens to AAVE governance tokens.
This IIP proposes a specific LEND to AAVE upgrade path.

## Motivation
99% of the Aave community have voted for the LEND to AAVE migration. The new Aave token features new tokenomics and governance features such as staking. For the DPI Set to accurately represent a stake in the Aave protocol the DPI Set must migrate its LEND tokens to AAVE tokens.

**FOR**:
* Upgrade LEND to AAVE tokens according to the IIP-1 proposal.
 
**AGAINST**:
* Do not upgrade LEND to AAVE tokens.
* Upgrade LEND to AAVE tokens according to a different specification.

## Specification
<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview
<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the IIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->
This is a high level overview of *how* the IIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.

### Rationale
<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

### Technical Specification
<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Index Coop currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

### Test Cases
