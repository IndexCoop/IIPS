## Simple Summary

Update max trade size from 600 ETH to 400 ETH

## Abstract

Adjust the following parameters on the ETH2x-FLI:
Lower max trade size from 600 ETH to 400 ETH.

## Motivation

The ETH2x-FLI product has several parameters that can be updated through governance. For more information on frequently updated parameters, view [this page.](https://docs.indexcoop.com/governance/fli-strategy-parameter-updates) The max trade size is the maximum amount of collateral asset allowed to be exchanged in a single transaction. The rebalance will be broken down across multiple transactions if the total rebalance notional is above the max trade size parameter.

Since the initial launch of ETH2x-FLI, ETH price has increased significantly while liquidity on DEXs have generally stayed the same. To target a 0.5% price impact per trade and keep market impact minimal on trades, we want to lower the max trade size to 400 ETH.

**FOR**

- Lower ETH-FLI max trade size from 600 ETH to 400 ETH

**AGAINST**

- Do not ETH-FLI lower max trade size.
