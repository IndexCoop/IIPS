## Simple Summary

INDEX currently suffers from low liquidity. This makes INDEX highly volatile and disqualifies it from inclusion in DPI. Further, we are receiving inbound seeking OTC deals due to low liquidity.

Our proposal is to increase INDEX liquidity in two steps:

- Sell INDEX tokens out of the Index Coop Static Treasury for ETH
- Provide liquidity to a Balancer or Uniswap Pool using INDEX and raised ETH
