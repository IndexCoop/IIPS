## Simple Summary

Grant the Index Coop Treasury Committee additional funds from the Index Coop Treasury to continue rewarding Index Coop contributions.

## Abstract

The Treasury Committee is seeking a grant of 30,000 INDEX tokens from the Index Coop Treasury.
These funds will be used to reward contributors in the monthly contributions round up, the newly launched bounty program, and future initiatives at the discretion of the Treasury Committee. This grant is expected to be sustain Index Coop contributor rewards until the end of Q1 2021.

The Treasury Committee's Index token distribution for October is listed here.
The Treasury Committee's wallet transactions is available for audit here.

## Motivation

The Index Coop Treasury Committee is expected to have just enough funds to reward all contributors in the November reward distribution. To continue rewarding contributors for work towards the Index Coop an additional grant of funds is required.

The Index Coop Treasury Committee was entrusted with distributing 10,000 in INDEX rewards for contributions to the Index Coop. The Index Coop Treasury Committee contends it has distributed those rewards according to principles of Fairness, Sensibility & Flexibility [set forth in the original IIP](./iip-004.md).

This proposal adheres to the same aims and goals outlined in IIP-4. A vote for this proposal is essentially a vote to continue down the path outlined in IIP-4.

#### FOR

- Grant the Index Coop Treasury Committee 30,000 INDEX to continue reward ditsribution to Index Coop contributors.

#### AGAINST

- Do not grant the Index Coop Treasury Committee additional funds to continue reward distributions to Index Coop contributors.
