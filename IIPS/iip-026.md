## Simple Summary

Make the following changes to the Index Improvement Proposal Process:

- Move hosting of IIPs to the indexcoop gitbook
- Remove quorum requirements for all IIPs
- Change waiting period before an IIP can be called to vote on
- Add a second class of fast-track IIPs with reduced requirements

## Abstract

If accepted, this proposal will make several changes to the Index Improvement Proposal process.

1. Move hosting of IIPs to the indexcoop gitbook [found here.](https://docs.indexcoop.com/)  
   The current Github repo will be updated with a deprecation message and a link to the indexcoop gitbook.  
   The indexcoop gitbook will be the source of truth regarding the statuses of all IIPs.

1. Remove quorum requirements for all IIPs, including Metagovernance votes.  
   The passing thresholds for Decision Gate 1 & 2 votes will remain 60%.  
   The passing thresholds for all other IIPs will remain 50%.

1. Change waiting period before an IIP can be called to vote on.  
   Currently, a vote can only be called on an IIP _after_ spending a minimum of 7 days in "proposed" state.  
   The "proposed" state implies the IIPs parameters have been finalized.  
   This IIP would change the waiting period before a vote can be called to 3 days (72 hours) minimum in "proposed" state.

1. Add a second class of fast-track IIPs with reduced requirements.  
   Any IIP can now include an "option to extend" clause.  
   This signals that a similar IIP with minor changes may be proposed in the near future  
   (e.g. DPI Liquidity Mining extensions in IIPs [11](./iip-011.md), [12](./iip-012.md), [14](./iip-014.md) and [19](./iip-019.md)).  
   Such a future IIP must reference the IIP it is extending.
   The future IIP will have no minimum wait period in "proposed" state before a vote can be called.  
   All other standard IIP rules still apply.

## Motivation

The original Index Improvement Proposal program was created just days after the Index Coop was launched. Since then, weâ€™ve created and voted on more than 20 IIPs and have a much better understanding of the needs of the Coop. This IIP suggests improvements to the IIP process to better serve Index Coop's needs.

Some of the problems we've identified with the current IIP process:

- The IIP process primarily lives on Github. A working knowledge of git is required to create a proposal. This is a significant barrier to entry for non-technical contributors, of which we have many.
- It's hard to argue what is gained from having a quorum requirement on IIPs given the IIP voting process is public and carried out over several days.
- The waiting period before an IIP vote can be called feels long and is not always obeyed.
- There are a certain class of proposals (mainly the Liquidity Extension IIPs) where the current IIP process seems onerous.

The IIP process is successful insofar as it helps us better run the Index Coop and gather consensus. The hope behind this IIP is that by agreeing to reduced requirements for the IIP process, we can get higher compliance with the remaining requirements that are critical to reaching consensus.
