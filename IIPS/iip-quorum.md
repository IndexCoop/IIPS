## Simple Summary

Reduce the quorum requirement for IIPs.

## Abstract

Current quorum requirements for IIPS are:
40% of circulating tokens for Index Product Additions
20% of circulating tokens for all other IIPS

This IIP proposes reducing overall quorum requirements:
5% for all IIPs

## Motivation

The Index Coop is continuing to formalize its processes for decentralized organization. The move toward using Snapshot for voting on Index Improvement Proposals has led us to begin scrutinizing existing governance processes and laying out their purposes clearly.

One organizing rule being revisited is the quorum requirement for IIPs. For an IIP vote to be considered valid a certain percentage of circulating tokens must vote in the proposal.

We believe this quorum requirement is currently too high and that a reduced quorum requirement will not meaningfully diminish the security or integrity of the IIP process. Rather, we contend a reduced quorum requirement will better represent the interests & intent of the Index Coop.

- **FOR** - Reduce quorum requirement for all IIPs to 5% of circulating tokens
- **AGAINST** - Do not change the current quorum requirements for IIPs

## Specification

### Overview

Traditionally, a quorum requirement protects an organization from having a small number of members taking action on behalf of an organization that does not accurately reflect the collective interest. Organizations that typically have quorums are government committees, homeowners associations, and company boards.

The governance process for IIPs is materially different from these kinds of organizations in a few ways:
All votes for IIPs are conducted publicly and posted on the Index Coopâ€™s snapshot page
The voting period for every IIP lasts several days

This public and extended voting period greatly reduces the risk that a small number of members may carry out non representative actions that bind the organization.

In the context of the Index Coop, we believe a quorum requirement should rarely block an IIP from passing, and should instead be used as a sanity check that the Coop is sufficiently motivated.

### Rationale

This IIP proposes a 5% quorum requirement for all IIPs.

A single quorum requirement simplifies governance processes. A low quorum requirement also enables the Index Coop to stay nimble and adapt to the changing DeFi landscape.

For comparison:
Uniswap has a quorum requirement of 4% of total supply.
AAVE has a quorum requirement of 2% of total supply.
Compound has a quorum requirement of 4% of total supply.
Maker DAO has no quorum requirement.
