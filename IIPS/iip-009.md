<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged IIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new IIPs. Note that an IIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your IIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `iip-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->
Include unclaimed INDEX rewards and INDEX in LP pools in a user’s vote weight in snapshot governance. This allows both small holders who cannot often claim due to gas costs to have the voting power they deserve and large holders to increase the liquidity on INDEX pairs without reducing their governance power.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the IIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the IIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->
Index Coop’s current Snapshot vote-counting strategy simply weights your votes based on how many INDEX tokens an address owns. Many users have unclaimed tokens from the UNI LP farming program and tokens locked in INDEX based LP pools. These votes are not eligible to vote on Snapshot governance. This proposal would allow unclaimed tokens and tokens in LP positions to be included in Snapshot votes.


## Motivation
<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the IIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the IIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the IIP will address the issue!-->
As of now, unclaimed rewards not being counted in the vote is a very minor problem, but as the emission rate of INDEX rewards slows, it becomes more apparent. For example, if in the future, farming programs may produce a more modest 10% APY. A user staking just $500 worth of DPI would make $50 in INDEX rewards each year. At the time of writing this, claiming your rewards costs ~$5. This would make it highly inefficient to claim more than once or twice per year, significantly diluting the voting power of this user between claims.

Many large holder may lock their INDEX in liquidity pools. This benefits the Index ecosystem by reducing slippage in INDEX trades. Unfortunately, these holders cannot participate in governance, even though they may be significantly invested in INDEX.

#### For:
- Include unclaimed INDEX rewards & INDEX LP tokens as voting rights in snapshot proposals

#### Against:
- Do not make any changes to the current snapshot voting rights

## Specification
<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview
<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the IIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->
Snapshot allows organizations to select from a range of different “strategies” to count an address’s voting power. I have written up modifcations to the Index's Snapshot space that would include uncalimed tokens and tokens locked in LP pools in the vote.

### Rationale
<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->
Changing Snapshot is simple to do, and many prominant protocols have done this to acheive their goals. Furthermore, this proposal requires no changes on-chain, making this a relatively low risk proposal.

### Technical Specification
<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Index Coop currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->
